The second part contains the individual model implementation, validation and fine-tune, where many individual models were tested. The third one contains the process of base models and emsemble  (stacking) implementation and validation. Also in the third part, after final model implementation, the test dataset is applied for the learner perform predicions and the submission file is created.\n",
