### House Price: Advanced Regression Techniques


**INSTALL**

This project requires Python 2.7 and the libraries listed below:

* [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [IPython](http://ipython.org/)
* [Python -math](https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html)


You will need a software that support run and excecute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). As example, you might install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

**KAGGLE'S COMPETITION**

All infomration about [*House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) is provided by Kaggle. 

**REPORT**

The document directly provide called report contains the description of the whole project development.

**CODE**
   
The project development is divided into X parts. The first one contains data exploration and preprocessing steps where the output is the data cleaned. The second part contains the individual model implementation, validation and fine-tune, where many individual models were tested. The third one contains the process of base models and emsemble  (stacking) implementation and validation. Also in the third part, after final model implementation, the test dataset is applied for the learner perform predicions and the submission file is created.
